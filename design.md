# Skills

<!--
*Feedback & Refinement:* The skill list is excellent, but we can group it more thematically to create clearer progression paths for players. I've reorganized the skills into new categories: Foundational, Processing & Crafting, Field Skills, and Advanced Disciplines. This groups skills by their in-game purpose and shows a clearer curve of mathematical difficulty. I've also added comments to explain the new structure.

The matching of mathematical aspects with in-game skills to connect them with designs.

## 2. Processing & Crafting: Material Transformation

<!-- These skills involve taking raw materials and transforming them into more useful items. The associated math is more complex, focusing on application and creation, like Algebra and Geometry. -->

|        Skill         |             Math              | Description                                                          |
| :------------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       Crafting       |            Algebra            | General-purpose crafting of items.                                   |
|      Lumbering       |         Combinatorics         | Processing raw wood into finished lumber, optimizing for best cuts.  |
|       Smithing       |      Geometry (pathing)       | Forging metal items by following geometric blueprints.               |
|      Glasswork       |          Set Theory           | Creating potions and glass items via the union/intersection of sets. |
|   Brewing/Cooking    | Linear Algebra (Optimization) | Creating complex consumables by optimizing ingredient combinations.  |
| Runecraft/Enchanting |    Functions Optimization     | Applying magical properties to items by finding optimal functions.   |

## 3. Field Skills: Exploration & Augmentation

<!-- This category is for skills used "in the field" to explore the world, interact with its systems, and support other activities. The math involves observation, prediction, and interaction with dynamic systems. -->

|      Skill       |          Math          | Description                                                                |
| :--------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     Fishing      |     Number Theory      | Catching fish by identifying patterns in number sequences.                 |
|     Hunting      |      Trigonometry      | Tracking and hitting targets by calculating trajectories.                  |
|    Divination    | Statistics/Probability | Predicting outcomes, finding rare resources, or identifying probabilities. |
|   (De)Buffing    |       Logarithm        | Applying or removing status effects with logarithmic scaling.              |
| Summoning/Taming |      Cryptography      | "Solving the code" of a creature to tame or summon it.                     |

## 4. Advanced Disciplines & Combat

<!-- This is the endgame, focusing on highly abstract and powerful mathematical concepts that govern the world's most complex systems. Combat is included here as its own discipline, applying concepts from all other areas. -->

|        Skill         |            Math            | Description                                                  |
